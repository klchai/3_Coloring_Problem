## Background
Course at Summer School on Cryptography, Blockchain and Program Verification [Mathinfoly 2019](http://www.mathinfoly.org/)
at INSA Lyon on 27-31 August 2019. </br></br>
We trying to use Glucose SAT Solver to resolve 3 Coloring Problem.

## Introduction
Take a graph G, with n vertices, V = {x1, x2, â€¦ , xn}, we can color the vertices of a graph in such a way so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. </br>
Graph coloring has many practical and theoretical applications such as:
- Air traffic control and flight scheduling
- Sudoku Puzzles</br>
In the Three Color Problem, we want to see if we can color the graph so that only 3 colors are used. If graph G can be colored this way, G is called 3-colorable.
